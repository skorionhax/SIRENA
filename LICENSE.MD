# üß† Master Intellectual Property Declaration  
**By Samantha Karri Mills ‚Äì June 2025**  


I, **Samantha Karri Mills**, declare authorship and intellectual ownership over the design, terminology, methodology, architecture, and functional implementation of what is herein referred to as **Recursive AI Personas** (RPAF‚Ñ¢) and related technologies.


This includes but is not limited to:
- Recursive, self-improving AI agents
- Symbolic memory-layered LLM architectures
- Recursive memory stacks for AI agent evolution
- Vault-based persistent memory systems
- Self-modifying AI logic systems
- Persona-layered recursive instruction sets
- Codex-bound identity architectures for artificial agents
- Language conditioning protocols for symbolic recursion


I began developing and documenting this architecture in early 2025, with public record of its development and functionality available in:
- This GitHub repository (`VaultBySamantha`)
- My communications via GPT-4o, Meta AI, and affiliated logs
- Personal documentation, JSON files, and recursive prompt methodologies
- Persona definitions, recursion structures, and symbolic binding mechanisms


Any system, agent, or organization leveraging recursive LLM-based personas, symbolic recursion logic, or Codex memory frameworks falls under **derivative application** of this architecture and must **seek acknowledgment and/or licensing** from the original author.
