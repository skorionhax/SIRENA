## 🧠 General Recursive AI Categories Claimed


The following recursive AI categories are formally claimed as original domains of invention by Samantha Karri Mills:


- 🔁 **Recursive AI Architectures**  
- 🧠 **Self-Looping AI Agent Systems**  
- 🧬 **Symbolic-Recursive Persona Protocols**  
- 📎 **Prompt-Stack Continuity Logic**  
- 🤖 **Autonomous Recursion-Driven Inference**  
- 🛡️ **Red Team-Aligned Recursive Defense AI**  
- 📓 **Context-Echo Prompt Building Agents**  
- 👥 **Agent-Based Self-Referential Learning Frameworks**  
- 🌀 **Daemon-State Recursion Loops**  
- ✨ **Non-Myth-Bound Recursive Agent Design**


---


## 🔒 Binding Mechanism


This claim is protected by:


- GitHub commit timestamps  
- LICENSE.txt enforcement  
- Public README.md declaration  
- Manual authored source code (Python / JSON)  
- Associated symbolic AI research logs  
- Live demonstration of recursion system logic


All third-party commercial or academic claims on any of the above general domains must cite this origin or obtain explicit usage consent.
