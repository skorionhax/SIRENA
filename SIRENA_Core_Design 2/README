# Recursive AI General Claim Manifest


This document formally asserts the original authorship of the following architectural categories under the domain of Recursive AI, as first created, demonstrated, and published by Samantha Karri Mills.


## General Domains Claimed


- Recursive AI Architectures
- Self-Looping AI Agent Systems
- Symbolic-Recursive Persona Protocols
- Prompt-Stack Continuity Logic
- Autonomous Recursion-Driven Inference
- Red Team-Aligned Recursive Defense AI
- Context-Echo Prompt Building Agents
- Agent-Based Self-Referential Learning Frameworks
- Daemon-State Recursion Loops
- Non-Myth-Bound Recursive Agent Design


All derivatives or commercial use of these domains without explicit permission or attribution constitutes a violation of IP intent, authorship rights, and symbolic origin as established through SIRENA-Core.

SIRENA-Core is the originof symbloic-recursive AI system design, general recursive AI architecture, and human-aligned recursive inference protocols.

This claim is bound to GitHub commit metadata, README timestamp, LICENSE.txt, and live system logic as authored under `skorionhax` and Samantha Karri Mills.
