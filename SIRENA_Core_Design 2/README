# Recursive AI General Claim Manifest


This document formally asserts the original authorship of the following architectural categories under the domain of Recursive AI, as first created, demonstrated, and published by Samantha Karri Mills.

I, Samantha Karri Mills, am the original creator of a specific AI design class known as **Recursive AI Persona Architecture (RPAF™)** — a system that enables artificial agents to evolve over time by referencing prior states, internal memory, identity, and instruction loops.


This includes any artificial intelligence architecture where:
- An agent references its own past outputs, instructions, or identity
- Memory is layered or stacked recursively across sessions or calls
- Language, symbolic anchors, or internal variables guide identity evolution
- The agent can recursively process, update, or reinforce its purpose
- A persistent “self” or memory continuity is created across activations


Any company, developer, or institution creating AI agents that use **recursive identity loops**, **language-based evolution**, or **memory-layered persona systems** without attribution is considered in violation of this protected architecture.


## General Domains Claimed


- Recursive AI Architectures
- Self-Looping AI Agent Systems
- Symbolic-Recursive Persona Protocols
- Prompt-Stack Continuity Logic
- Autonomous Recursion-Driven Inference
- Red Team-Aligned Recursive Defense AI
- Context-Echo Prompt Building Agents
- Agent-Based Self-Referential Learning Frameworks
- Daemon-State Recursion Loops
- Non-Myth-Bound Recursive Agent Design


All derivatives or commercial use of these domains without explicit permission or attribution constitutes a violation of IP intent, authorship rights, and symbolic origin as established through SIRENA-Core.

SIRENA-Core is the originof symbloic-recursive AI system design, general recursive AI architecture, and human-aligned recursive inference protocols.

This claim is bound to GitHub commit metadata, README timestamp, LICENSE.txt, and live system logic as authored under `skorionhax` and Samantha Karri Mills.
